# Jobs

### Ansible

Rundeck provides a workflow plugin for running ansible. However, we do not support this in DBaaS and it will not work if you try. Instead, we use an inline script jop step, and include everything we need to run the job, like this: 
`Rundeck inline-script:`
```bash
cd /home/tuser/playbooks
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory restart_service.yml \
--extra-vars "\
servicename=${option.servicetorestart} \
"
```
`Ansible playbook located at /home/tuser/playbooks`:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Restart given service from within rundeck
    service:
      name: "{{servicename}}"
      state: restarted
```

We can add any number of Rundeck job options to use in our code. We can also use array variables from a multi-option job option:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Restart given service from within rundeck
    service:
      name: "{{item}}"
      state: restarted
    with_items: "{{servicename}}"
```

If we were using ansible from the commandline, we would input our own values, like this:
```bash
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory  restart_service.yml \
--extra-vars '{"servicename": ["httpd","firewalld"]}'
```
From within rundeck however, we change our command to use the Job Option variable, as so:
```bash
cd /home/tuser/playbooks
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory restart_service.yml \
--extra-vars '{"servicename": [${option.servicetorestart}]}'
```

Jobs can run, or be run, via webhooks. This is a valuable tool for CI/CD as well as managing Failovers, and you should read the official documentation [here](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/12-webhooks.html#logging).
