## Goals
* the trainee will be familiar with the conpect of sharding
* the trainee will be familiar with Redis implementation of sharding
* the trainee will learn about Redis sharding limitations and effects

## Tasks
* What is Redis Clustering (Sharding)?
* What is Hashtags and Hashslots?
* What Redis features are banned or limited in Redis Clustering (Sharding)?
* Do the following Task:
  * Deploy a Redis database with 2 nodes and Clustering (Sharding) enabled
  * Run the following commands:
  ```
      MSET key1 "foo" key2 "bar"
      MGET key1 key2
      RENAME key1 key2
      SUNION set1 set2
      EVAL "return {redis.call('GET', KEYS[1]), redis.call('GET', KEYS[2])}" 2 key1 key2
  ```
  * Explain the commands purpose
  * What may be the issue when running those commands on a Redis Cluster (Sharded Redis)?
  * What principle solves that issue?, Fix the commands using it.
* What are Shard placement policies in Redis Enterprise Cluster?
* How does Redis re-sharding work?
* What are the effects of Redis re-sharding?
